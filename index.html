		<h3>About Microbiota</h3>
		The microbiota can be considered a “new organ” which actually constitutes 2 kg of our body and an estimated 80% of its components has not yet been cultivated. Biomarkers and novel drug candidates could potentially be found in the highly metabolically active bacteria. An example is the antibacterial molecule Lactocillin produced by Lactobacillus gasseri (a vaginal bacteria). The tools used to study the microbiota have benefitted greatly from the major advances in high throughput analysis of molecules at the DNA, RNA, protein and metabolite levels, usually collected under the terminology “omics-platforms”.
